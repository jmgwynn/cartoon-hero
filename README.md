# cartoon-hero
A website created during a Skillshare class where I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. On top of that I learned a bit of JavaScript on my own and implemented it in a later version. The base site can be found at https://jmgwynn.github.io/cartoon-hero/ and the version with javascript can be found at https://jmgwynn.github.io/cartoon-hero/jQuery_Version.html The javascript is used to allow collapsing of all of the elements in between headers.
